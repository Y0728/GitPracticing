The repo for git practicing.


Today is 2th July 2021, 4 days have been go by since my start the summer intern in MicroSoft.
I feel so terrible. I have no idea about anything. Saddly, I have not finished my first check in so far and it seems I run after other interns. The group I was assigned doesn't do the work about algorithm. I really want to quit but I am not sure whether it is a correct choice.
